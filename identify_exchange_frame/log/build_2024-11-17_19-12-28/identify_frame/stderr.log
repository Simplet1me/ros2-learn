[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findimage_transport_plugins.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "image_transport_plugins", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "image_transport_plugins" with any of the following names:

    image_transport_pluginsConfig.cmake
    image_transport_plugins-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "image_transport_plugins" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "image_transport_plugins_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "image_transport_plugins" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
