[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:30 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPCL_conversions.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "PCL_conversions", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PCL_conversions"
  with any of the following names:

    PCL_conversionsConfig.cmake
    pcl_conversions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PCL_conversions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "PCL_conversions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "PCL_conversions" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
